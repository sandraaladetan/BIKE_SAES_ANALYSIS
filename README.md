Introduction 

In pursuit of enhancing the company's performance and fostering strategic growth, I undertook a comprehensive bike-scale analysis.

 Arriving at a conclusion.

The analysis I conducted aimed to determine the number of bikes purchased and tp address these specific questions.

1. Which group of people bought more bikes?
3. Which set of people commuted longer distances?
4. The percentage of the population that bought bikes?
5. The region where bikes were purchased most frequently?
6. The demographic that purchased bikes most frequently?

PROCESS

The dataset was initially imported into Excel for cleaning, wherein i meticulously handled various aspects including data types, duplicates, null values and spelling errors. Additionally, i categorized age into distinct brackets to facilitate seamless analysis. The subsequent visualization process was also executed within the Excel environment.

INSIGHT 

1. Individuals who bought bikes tended to cover greater distances compared to those who didn't.
2. A larger proportion of the population opted to purchase bikes from the total population.
3. The North America region saw a higher frequency of bike purchases.
4. Married individuals, in particular, showed a higher tendency to buy bikes compared to single individuals.
5. Among the demographic, professionals stood out as the group that made more bike purchases.
6. The middle-age bracket emerged as the age group with the highest frequency of bike purchases.

RECOMMENDATION

3. Strengthen Presence in North America: Allocate resources and marketing efforts to capitalize on the higher frequency of bike purchases in the North America region. This could involve tailored campaigns or partnerships with local entities.

4. Cater to Married Couples: Develop marketing campaigns and incentives that specifically resonate with married individuals, acknowledging their higher likelihood of purchasing bikes.

5. Professional-Focused Campaigns: Create targeted campaigns catering to professionals, highlighting how biking aligns with their lifestyle and needs. Emphasize benefits like fitness, time efficiency, and environmental consciousness.
